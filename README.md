# Html-Practice
# HPractice  3

These are just some practice projects I'm doing as advance my knowledge of web development.
I'll try to upload at least 7 times daily to my github as I also get familiar with Git
and other programs like Jasmine. 

I've previously worked with Java and Visual Basic, so I already have an understanding of coding.

I have also worked with Python, C+ and a small bit of Ruby. This is to help me 
keep working to master all that knowledge I have, instead of just scattered tidbit projects.
